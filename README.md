```bash
Usage: ./copy-deployment.rb [options]
-s, --src <id>                   Source account ID
-d, --dst <id>                   Destination account ID
-e, --deployment <id>            Source deployment ID to be migrated
-g, --group <id>                 Export ServerTemplates to Publishing Group ID
```

Credential setup
----------------
* Credentials can be directly entered into the script by editing the `@api` hash parameters.
* Credentials can also be stored in `~/.rsc` which is generated by running `rsc setup`.
* Note: This script does not encode/decode the password credentials stored in `~/.rsc`. Create a json key with name `api_password`, to store the password using this script.
